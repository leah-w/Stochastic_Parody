This project called Shochastic Parody is a programming language that generates song parodies. The user is able to modify an existing song to create a parody that makes reasonable sense and doesn't require prior knowledge of music. It also randomly generates a new output each time so that it produces a myriad of different paradies. Requested words are translated to fit into the base melodies where part of speech and rhyme is preserved. This project was created in collaberation with Matt Laws.
