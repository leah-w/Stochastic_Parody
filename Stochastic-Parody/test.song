!Hey there, Delilah
What's it like in New York city?
I'm a !thousand miles $away
But, girl, tonight you look so pretty
Yes, you do
Times !Square can't shine $as bright as you
I swear, it's true
Hey there, Delilah
Don't you worry about the $distance

section = [
    I'm !right there if you get lonely
    Give this song another $listen
    Close your eyes
]

Listen to my voice, $it's my disguise
I'm by your side
